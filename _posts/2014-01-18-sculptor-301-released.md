This bug fix release brings additional examples and some improvements to Sculptors Eclipse and Maven support, e.g.

* additional validations and quickfixes in the [DSL editor][2]
* better integration with the [m2e Eclipse plugin](http://www.eclipse.org/m2e/) 
* support for Maven 3.1 in [Maven plugin][3]
* support for MongoDB in [Maven archetype][4]

So check out the new version of Sculptors [Eclipse plugin][2] (available from [http://sculptorgenerator.org/updates](http://sculptorgenerator.org/updates)) and the [Maven plugin][3] (available from [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22org.sculptorgenerator%22)).
