Only two weeks after the [big 1.7.0][1] we are happy to deliver another major release - 1.8.0. This time it is no new functionality, but the usability of DSL editor is much, much better.

We have migrated from openArchitectureWare 4.3.1 to Xtext/Xpand/MWE 0.7.2 at Eclipse.org. Many thanks to Todd Ferrell for doing most of this migration.

Now, content assist (ctrl + space) works as you would expect.

Another useful feature is formatting (pretty printing) of model files (ctrl%2Bshift%2BF).
