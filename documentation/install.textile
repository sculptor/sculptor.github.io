This instruction describes what you need to install and configure to be able to use Sculptor as normal developer, e.g. for getting started with the [Hello World Tutorial|2. Hello World Tutorial (CSC)].

Table of Contents:
{toc}
h2. JDK

Install [JDK 6|http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads].

h2. Maven

Maven is used for generating source code and building the system.

1. Install [Maven 3.0.x|http://maven.apache.org/download.html].

2. Define JAVA_HOME environment variable.
bq..
I often put JAVA_HOME and MAVEN_OPTS directly in mvn.bat. I increase the heap size for better performance and avoiding out of memory.
Windows:
@
set JAVA_HOME=c:\devtools\jdk1.6.0_03
set MAVEN_OPTS=-Xms128m -Xmx1024m
@

Mac OS X:
@
JAVA_HOME=/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.6.0/Home
MAVEN_OPTS="-Xms128m -Xmx1024m"

h2. Eclipse and Sculptor Plugins for Xtext 1.0.1

Sculptor can be used with a text editor or any IDE, but if you are an Eclipse user it is recommended that you install the following Eclipse plugins to be able to use DSL editor with error highlight, code completion, and outline.

1. Install [Eclipse 3.7 Indigo|http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/], Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers.

2. Directly in Eclipse (Help \-> Install New Software) install from Helios update site - [http://download.eclipse.org/releases/helios]

* Modeling > MWE 2 runtime SDK 1.0.1
* Modeling > Xpand SDK 1.0.1
* Modeling > Xtext SDK 1.0.1

{note}Use version 1.0.1 from Helios update site, not 1.0.2, or later.
Be careful when updating Indigo to SR2. Make sure that you deselect the modeling tools,
otherwise versions that are incompatible with Sculptor will be installed.
If you need to use Xtext 2.1 you can try the experimental Sculptor plugin, as described below.
{note}

3. Sculptor Plugins

Sculptor version 2.1.0.x is available at update Site: [http://fornax-platform.org/updatesite/site.xml].
Install Sculptor DSL Feature 2.1.0.x.
If you are going to develop rich clients you should also install Sculptor Rich Client Feature 2.1.0.x.

h2. Eclipse and Experimental Sculptor Plugins for Xtext 2.1

An alternative to the above is to use the experimental Sculptor plugin for Xtext 2.1.

1. Install [Eclipse 3.7 Indigo|http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/], Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers.

2. Directly in Eclipse (Help \-> Install New Software) install from Itemis update site - [http://download.itemis.com/updates/releases]

* TMF Xtext-2.1.1 (2.1.x) > Xtext SDK 2.1.1

3. Sculptor Plugins

Sculptor version 2.2.0.x is available at update Site: [http://fornax-platform.org/updatesite/site.xml].
Install Sculptor Experimental > Sculptor DSL Feature 2.2.0.x.

h2. Configuration in Eclipse

Add 'Classpath Variable' in Eclipse for M2_REPO=<your local repository location>
You find this setting in Window \-> Preferences \-> Java \-> Build Path \-> Classpath Variables
The local repository location is by default in .m2/repository in your home directory (Document and Settings in Windows)

Add 'String Substitution Variable' in Eclipse for MAVEN_EXEC=<MAVEN_HOME>/bin/mvn.bat
{tip}If you are using Mac OS X you should change the default file encoding in Eclipse to ISO-8859-1 via Preferences \-> General \-> Workspace
{tip}
h2. Maven Launcher

Maven can be executed from the command prompt, but when developing a better alternative is to run it inside Eclipse as an external tool. You can checkout some preconfigured launchers from Fornax Subversion repository. The menu items for this are available in the external tools menu.

Checkout [https://fornax.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/fornax/trunk/maven-launcher/]

Use the subversive plugin, open view SVN Repositories. Connect to the Subversion repository root: [https://fornax.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/fornax/]

{tip}If you don't see the list of fornax maven commands under the 'External tools' menu in Eclipse, try closing the 'Maven Launcher' project and open it again.
{tip}

h2. Eclipse Maven Integration (m2e)

If you like you can use the Eclipse plugin [Maven Integration (m2e)|http://www.eclipse.org/m2e/] instead of the combination of Maven plugin {{eclipse:eclipse}} and Maven Launcher.

To add support for Sculptors Maven plugins to m2e you can install the Eclipse plugin "Fornax M2E Extensions" from Sculptors Eclipse update site. This plugin provides the following features:

* It configures the [lifecycle mapping|http://wiki.eclipse.org/M2E_plugin_execution_not_covered] for Sculptors Maven plugins to keep m2e from running them during an Eclipse build. 
* It adds the folders containing the generated code to Eclipses Java build path

The plugin is activated if you import/create a new Maven project or selecting "Maven \-> Update Project Configuration..." from a Maven projects context menu.

{tip}The Fornax M2E Extensions plugin is activated for a Maven project only if the Sculptor Maven plugins (mainly the OAW Workflow plugin) are NOT already deactivated in the POM via the [m2e Maven plugin "org.eclipse.m2e.lifecycle-mapping" ignore goal|http://wiki.eclipse.org/M2E_plugin_execution_not_covered#ignore_plugin_goal].{tip}

h2. Continue

Now you are ready to continue with the [2. Hello World Tutorial (CSC)|2. Hello World Tutorial (CSC)].
