As mentioned in the [installation guide](installation#eclipse) does Sculptor come with an eclipse-based text editor for Sculptors DSL:

![Sculptor Text Editor](/images/documentation/eclipse-plugin/editor.png)


## Features

This text editor is generated by [Xtext](http://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/) from the [grammar definition of Sculptors DSL](https://github.com/sculptor/sculptor/blob/master/sculptor-eclipse/org.sculptor.dsl/src/org/sculptor/dsl/Sculptordsl.xtext). Some of the editors features (based on [Xtexts IDE concepts](http://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/documentation/304_ide_concepts.html)) are described in the following chapters.


### Syntax Coloring

The editor is capable to mark up your model-code to improve the overall readability:

![Syntax Coloring Sample](/images/documentation/eclipse-plugin/syntax-coloring-sample.png)

It is possible to use different colors and fonts according to the meaning of the different parts of your input file. This is configured in the corresponding Eclipse preferences page:

![Preferences Syntax Coloring](/images/documentation/eclipse-plugin/preferences-syntax-coloring.png)


### Code Formatting

Sculptors DSL editor provides a code formatter. In the editor press `Ctrl+Shift+F` on code to format it. If no selection is set then the entire model source is formatted otherwise only the selection will be.


### Content Assist

In the DSL editor press `Ctrl+Space` on code to complete. This opens a list of available code completions.

![Content Assist](/images/documentation/eclipse-plugin/content-assist.png)

Use the mouse or the keyboard (Up Arrow, Down Arrow, Page Up, Page Down, Home, End, Enter) to navigate and select lines in the list. Clicking or pressing Enter on a selected line in the list inserts the selection into the editor.


### Outline View

The DSL editor provides a view which displays an outline of the structure of the currently-active model file in the editor area.

![Outline View](/images/documentation/eclipse-plugin/outline-view.png)

This view provides tool bar buttons for activating the following features:

* linking the outline view with the editor
* sorting the outline tree nodes in alphabetically order

If not visible this view can be opened via `Window > Show View > Outline`.
{: .alert}


### Problem Markers with Quick Fixes

The DSL editor shows markers for problems (error or warning) within the model found while typing and after saving.

![Problem Markers](/images/documentation/eclipse-plugin/problem-markers.png)

For some types of problems the editor offers corrections. To show that correction proposals are available for a problem, a 'light bulb' is visible on the editor's annotation bar.

Left click on the light bulb or invoking `Ctrl+1 (Edit > Quick Fix)` brings up the proposals for the problem at the cursor position.
Each quick fix shows a preview when selected in the proposal window.

![Problem Marker with Quick Fix](/images/documentation/eclipse-plugin/problem-marker-with-quick-fix.png)

Quick fixes are also shown directly in problem hovers (but there, no preview is available).

![Problem Marker with Quick Fix in Hover](/images/documentation/eclipse-plugin/problem-marker-with-quick-fix-hover.png)


### Hyperlinking

The DSL editor allows navigating to the declaration of referenced model elements via hyperlinks. These hyperlinks are shown as a blue line while moving the cursor over a model reference with the `Ctrl` key pressed.

![Hyperlink](/images/documentation/eclipse-plugin/hyperlink.png)

An alternate way of navigating to the declaration of the referenced model element is by placing the cursor on the reference and pressing `F3`. 
{: .alert}


### Search

The DSL editor provides the following types of searches:

* Searching for references of a selected model element (activated by placing the cursor on a model element and pressing `Ctrl+Shift+G`)

  ![Search for references](/images/documentation/eclipse-plugin/search-references.png)

* Searching model elements in Xtexts [global index](http://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/documentation.html#index_based) (activated by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+F3`)

  ![Search for references](/images/documentation/eclipse-plugin/search-index.png)


### Rename Refactoring

The DSL editor provides rename refactoring of a model element (activated by placing the cursor on a model element and pression `Ctrl+Alt+R`).

![Rename refactoring](/images/documentation/eclipse-plugin/rename-refactoring.png)

For opening the preview press `Ctrl+Enter` instead of `Enter`. \\

{: .alert}


### Template Proposals

The DSL editor provides template proposals in the [content assist](#content-assist). 

![Template proposals](/images/documentation/eclipse-plugin/template-service-operation.png)

These templates can be modified (or new ones can be defined) via the corresponding preference page.

## Caveats

### Eclipse projects need Xtext Project Nature

Xtexts maintains internally a [global index](https://eclipse.org/Xtext/documentation/303_runtime_concepts.html#containers) of all model files. This index is used for hyperlinking and refactoring.

An xtext-specific [Eclipse builder](http://help.eclipse.org/juno/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.platform.doc.user%2Fconcepts%2Fconcepts-22.htm&cp=0_2_1_7) is used to update the index. To enable this builder every Eclipse project **with Sculptor models** must have the **Xtext project nature** set in their project properties.
{: .alert .alert-error}


### Automatic Build must be enabled

Xtexts maintains internally a [global index](https://eclipse.org/Xtext/documentation/303_runtime_concepts.html#containers) of all model files. This index is used for hyperlinking and refactoring.

An xtext-specific [Eclipse builder](http://help.eclipse.org/juno/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.platform.doc.user%2Fconcepts%2Fconcepts-22.htm&cp=0_2_1_7) is used to update the index. To execute this builder **automatically on resource changes** the option **"Project > Build automatically"** must be enabled for the Eclipse workspace.
